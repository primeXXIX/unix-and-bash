Exercises

1. Use the echo command and the redirect
operator > to make a file called foo.txt
containing the text “hello, world”.
Then, using the cp command, make a copy
of foo.txt called bar.txt. Using the diff
command, confirm that the contents of both
files are the same.

2. By combining the cat command and the redirect
operator >, create a copy of foo.txt called
baz.txt without using the cp command.

3. Create a file called quux.txt containing
the contents of foo.txt followed by the contents
of bar.txt. Hint: As noted in Section 2.1.1,
cat can take multiple arguments.

4. How do rm nonexistent and rm -f nonexistent
differ for a nonexistent file?

Solutions

1.  $ echo "hello, world" > foo.txt
    $ cp foo.txt bar.txt
    $ diff foo.txt bar.txt



2.  $ cat foo.txt > baz.txt
    $ diff foo.txt baz.txt
    //

3.  $ cat foo.txt > quux.txt bar.txt > quux.txt

4.  -f, If the file does not exist, do not display
a diagnostic message or modify the exit
\status to reflect an error.
