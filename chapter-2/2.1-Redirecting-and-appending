Exercise

1. Using echo and >, make files called line_1.txt and line_2.txt
containing the first and second lines of Sonnet 1, respectively.

2. Replicate the original sonnet_1.txt
(containing the first two lines of the sonnet)
by first redirecting the contents of line_1.txt and
then appending the contents of line_2.txt.
Call the new file sonnet_1_copy.txt,
and confirm using diff that itâ€™s identical to sonnet_1.txt.
Hint: When there is no diff between two files,
diff simply outputs nothing.

3. Use cat to combine the contents of line_1.txt and line_2.txt
in reverse order using a single command,
yielding the file sonnet_1_reversed.txt.

Hint: The cat command can take multiple arguments.

Solution

1. $ echo "From the fairest creatures we desire increase," > sonnet_1.txt
   $ echo "That thereby beauty's rose might never die," > sonnet_1.txt

2. $ echo "From the fairest creatures we desire increase," > sonnet_1_copy.txt
   $ echo "That thereby beauty's rose might never die," >> sonnet_1_copy.txt

   $ diff sonnet_1.txt sonnet_1_copy.txt

3. $ cat line_2.txt line_1.txt > sonnet_1_reversed.txt
